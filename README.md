# volcano-global

volcano-global is a multi-cluster task scheduling application
that cleverly combines the capabilities of [Karmada](https://karmada.io/) and [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/),
enabling `Volcano` to schedule tasks across multiple clusters.

This project originated from:
- [LFX Mentorship CNCF - Volcano: Volcano supports multi-cluster AI workloads scheduling](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/132a4971-6969-4ca6-a695-783ece3ac768)
- [OSPP 2024 Volcano supports queue capacity management capabilities in multi-cluster AI workload scheduling](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/prodetail/243ba0505?list=org&navpage=org)
